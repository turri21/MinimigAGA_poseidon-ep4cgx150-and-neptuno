Experimental P96 driver for the Minimig FPGA core.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Alastair M. Robinson
Huge thanks to the Replay team for releasing their own
P96 driver as open-source - this driver is based heavily
upon their work, and is thus under the same license - LGPL2.1.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install P96 using its installer.  You'll be prompted to pick a card
  (any card!) - it shouldn't matter which you choose, but I'll
  assume for the rest of these instructions that you chose PicassoIV.

  The P96 installer will create a new monitor file in Devs:Monitors

* Rename the newly-created "PicassoIV" monitor file to "Minimig"

* Edit the monitor file's tooltypes, changing the BOARDTYPE tooltype
  to minimig then save the changes.

* Copy the minimig.card file to libs:picasso96/

* Optionally, copy the Picasso96Settings file to Devs:
  (The Picasso96Settings file contains some pre-defined screenmodes
  which all work nicely on my Dell U2311H monitor - but may need
  tweaking, or just outright fail to work on other monitors.)

* Reboot, and you should be able to run Picasso96Mode to try out the
  various screenmodes, or select them from within applications.
